This repo houses the source code for SAFyR, my brand new programming language!  It is not ready for release yet, so expect bugs.  A new repo will be linked as soon as the production version is ready.  Feel free to reach out if you would like to contribute or have questions about the language.  This is my first attempt at creating a programming language in full, so be kind!

My main goal for SAFyR is to learn how to create a programming language.  That being said, I don't see why I can't explore the implementation of a wide range of features while I'm at it.  At its core, I would like SAFyR to be a fairly simple and lightweight language.  At the moment, I don't see implementing large projects in it.  It may evolve into something completely capable of that, though.  My second goal with this language is to be concise.  On the one hand, I want simple and easily readable syntax like is seen in Python (which incidentally is the language that SAFyR is being written in).

## Some Planned Features of SAFyR
* Static and dynamic typing
* A range of different operators for objects that are not available in other languages, or rely on functions
* Able to be interpreted or compiled (right now I plan to compile to LLVM bytecode)
* Multiple return values (definitely)
* Errors as values (possibly)
* Native streamlined control flows for error handling
* Interchangeable keywords (e.g. 'if' can always be replaced with '?')
* A mashup of struct and class ideas.  All objects will be represented as structs, and can have their behavior relative to a given function defined, but there will not be 'methods' per se.  I am not sure if I will stick with this one or not...
